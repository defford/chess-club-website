## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
1. **Achievement Detection**: Integrated into the game completion flow in `/api/games`
2. **Real-time Broadcasting**: Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for instant notifications
3. **UI Components**: React components with smooth animations and auto-dismiss
4. **Data Storage**: Achievements are logged and can be stored in Google Sheets

### Files Added/Modified

#### New Files
- `src/lib/achievements.ts` - Achievement detection logic and definitions
- `src/app/api/achievements/notifications/route.ts` - SSE endpoint for real-time notifications
- `src/components/ui/achievement-popup.tsx` - UI components for achievement popups

#### Modified Files
- `src/lib/types.ts` - Added achievement-related type definitions
- `src/app/api/games/route.ts` - Integrated achievement checking into game creation
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added achievement notification manager to global layout

### How It Works

1. **Game Completion**: When a game is recorded via the admin interface
2. **Achievement Check**: System analyzes player stats and recent games
3. **Achievement Detection**: Checks all achievement criteria for both players
4. **Notification Broadcast**: Sends achievement notifications to all connected clients
5. **UI Display**: Popups appear on all open browser tabs with smooth animations

### Browser Compatibility
- Works on all modern browsers that support Server-Sent Events
- Graceful fallback if SSE connection fails
- Auto-reconnection after connection drops

### Future Enhancements
- Achievement storage in Google Sheets
- Achievement history page
- Achievement badges on player profiles
- Custom achievement categories
- Achievement leaderboards

## Usage

The achievement system works automatically once integrated. No additional configuration is required. When admins record games through the existing game management interface, achievements will be detected and notifications will appear on all connected browser clients.

## Testing

To test the achievement system:
1. Record a game through the admin interface
2. Check that achievement notifications appear on all open browser tabs
3. Verify that achievements are properly detected based on player statistics
